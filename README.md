Dynamic Xpath Guvi
This project is created to validate and practice the usage of Dynamic XPath and XPath Axes in Selenium
automation by interacting with the elements on the website:
🔗 https://www.guvi.in/

Project Objective
The aim of this task is to build strong skills in crafting flexible and robust dynamic XPath expressions, 
improving element identification and navigation across parent-child relationships, siblings, and 
ancestor DOM structures.


Tasks Performed
1. Open Website
Navigate to the URL: https://www.guvi.in/
2. Identify Web Elements
Locate navigation menu elements dynamically using XPath for items such as Courses, Live Classes, Practice, 
Login, Sign Up, etc.



Relative XPATH Tasks:
Requirement- Description

1.Find the Parent element -Using the given element highlighted in red, locate its parent in DOM

2.Find the first Child element -Select the first child of the same parent

3.Locate the second Sibling- Identify the second sibling of the given element

4.Select parent of an element with attribute href - Use attribute-based dynamic XPath to find its parent element



4.XPath Axes Used:

XPath Axis- Purpose
1.ancestor::* -Find all ancestor elements
2.following-sibling::* - Locate all following sibling elements
3.preceding::* - Select all preceding elements


Tools & Technologies
Selenium WebDriver
Python / Java (any language used)
Browser: Chrome
IDE: Pycharm

Conclusion:
This reinforces the practical knowledge of Xpath strategies used for real time automation challenges.
